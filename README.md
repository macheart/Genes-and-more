# Genes-and-more
A microarray dataset with expression values for 87 probes for each of the 30 patients in a study cohort, was used to perform a t-test per microarray probe to evaluate differences between the two groups classified as having a good or poor prognosis (Table 1). Probes were ranked based on their p-values (Table 2), and the distribution of the expression values for the top 5 ranking probes (Table 3) were assessed between the good or poor prognosis classification.
